# Method Comparison Tool

## About

This solution provides a graphical user interface for comparing methods. The main objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive web application that allows to develop the different stages of a process of comparison of analytical methods of in vitro tests of a standard against 1 or more new test methods to be evaluated. 

## Getting Started

The solution is deployed on shinyapps -> [Launch the app](https://jasam.shinyapps.io/multi_method_comparison/)

## Features

* An intuitive, interactive and extensible application for compare two or more methods.
* Data sample with 1 to 3 methods in order to try the solution.
* Load CSV input file.
* Visual data analysis using Bland-Altman plot.
* Automatic regression modeling for all test and reference data. Ordinary linear regression, Deming, weighted Deming and Passing-Bablok.
* Detailed view including parameters for each model regression.
* Hypothesis testing for conclude if methods are interchangeable.
* Scoring using automatic selection best method and linear regression model.
* Reporting on PDF or HTML with results.

## Framework for Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples

In the clinical measurement of in-vitro tests, comparison of a new measurement technique against an established one to see if they match enough as so that the new one replaces the previous one and it is possible to have a sustenance to affirm that the methods are interchangeable, a guide that standardizes and proposes good practices for these studies is: [CLSI-EP09-A3](https://clsi.org/standards/products/method-evaluation/documents/ep09/)
